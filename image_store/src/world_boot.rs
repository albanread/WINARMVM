//! Booting the VM's world from the versioned image database instead of the
//! `world/*.mst` file tree (S22, "the concept is to retain source in the
//! database, and to switch to loading the world from the database").
//!
//! The database is the source of truth; this module replays it into a
//! genesis-only [`VmHandle`] (`macvm::embed::VmHandle::boot_without_world`)
//! by reconstructing each stored class's `.mst` definition and feeding it
//! through the VM's own compiler via `exec` (the run-for-effect twin of
//! `eval`, no printString) — the exact same path a `.mst`-file load uses
//! (`execute_top_item` → `install_class_def`), so a DB-booted world is the
//! same VM state as a file-booted one.
//!
//! Lives in `image_store` (not the `macvm` crate) on purpose: the VM stays
//! free of a SQLite dependency — the embedder wires the database to the VM
//! (the same separation `docs/SPEC.md` §16 draws for the whole GUI↔VM
//! boundary) — while `image_store` may depend on `macvm`'s `VmHandle`
//! freely; the constraint only ever ran one direction. Moved here from
//! `gui/src/world_boot.rs` (`docs/package_aware_editing_design.md` M2): that
//! crate is `[[bin]]`-only with no `[lib]` target, so nothing else could
//! ever depend on it — `cocoa_gui` needs this same replay logic to move its
//! own primary onto DB-boot (a later milestone), and `gui` keeps using it
//! via a one-line re-export (`crate::world_boot` in `gui/src/main.rs`) so
//! none of its own call sites needed to change.
//!
//! Correctness rests on three facts established when this was built (S22):
//! `all_classes()` returns classes in dependency-safe `load_order`
//! (superclass before subclass); the stored method `source` is now the FULL
//! method text (header + body), which `image_store`'s importer was fixed to
//! capture (without the parameter names in the header, a body-only record
//! could not be recompiled); and — critically — the compiler resolves a
//! global/class name at COMPILE time and does NOT auto-declare a forward
//! reference from inside a method body (`src/frontend/codegen.rs`
//! `resolve_var`: auto-declare fires only for a top-level *assignment* to an
//! uppercase name, never a read inside a method). The `.mst` load order
//! avoids forward references by construction; but the DB flattens each
//! class's reopens (e.g. `Object`'s `printString`, added in a much later
//! file, referencing `WriteStream`) onto the class's ORIGINAL `load_order`,
//! reintroducing them. So the load runs in TWO phases: first bind every
//! class global (its shell — superclass + ivars, no methods) in
//! `load_order`, then install every class's methods. By the time any method
//! compiles, every class name it could reference is already a bound global.
