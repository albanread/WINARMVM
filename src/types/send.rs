//! T3 (`docs/typechecker_design.md` §4/§6): the send rule — static-DNU +
//! per-argument subtype checks. Only ever checks a send whose RECEIVER
//! type is KNOWN (not `Dynamic`) — an unannotated receiver (still the
//! overwhelming majority of the real world today) is never checked at
//! all, matching the design's own "gradual typing finds little until
//! signatures exist." Cascades reuse this over the SAME receiver type for
//! every segment (`expr_type.rs`'s own Cascade handling), matching
//! `DeltaCascadedSend`'s rule.
//!
//! Known v1 simplification, stated rather than silently ignored: this
//! type system has no metaclass representation at all (a receiver's
//! `ResolvedType` only ever means "an instance of class X," never "the
//! class X itself"). A class-side send (`Foo new`) is unreachable by
//! construction — `expr_type::synthesize`'s `Var` case already answers
//! `Dynamic` for a bare global/class-name reference, so `find_method`
//! only ever needs to search `instance_methods`. The one place this
//! WOULD otherwise bite is `self`/`Self`/`super` used as a receiver
//! INSIDE a class-side method (there, `self` really means "the class,"
//! not "an instance of it") — `check_send` explicitly declines those
//! rather than silently checking them against the wrong table.
