//! `JitWriteGuard` — the sole path through which `codecache` (or its callers,
//! via [`crate::codecache::CodeCache`]'s own methods) may write to `MAP_JIT`
//! memory (`docs/sprints/sprint_s09_detail.md` D2.4).
//!
//! Every write to already-published code — a fresh `publish`, a
//! `patch_branch26`, a `patch_pool_word`, a batch of several under one GC
//! pass (S12 P5) — must happen between a guard's construction and its drop:
//! construction flips this thread's `MAP_JIT` pages to writable
//! (`arm64.md` §2's per-thread `pthread_jit_write_protect_np` toggle, not
//! `mprotect`); drop flips back to executable *first*, then invalidates the
//! icache over every noted range (P9 — that ordering matters: invalidating
//! before the exec-mode flip races a concurrent instruction fetch on
//! another core against a write this thread hasn't finished committing to
//! the executable view yet).
//!
//! WINARM (P0 D2#8) — the Windows-on-ARM64 reading of all of the above, which
//! changes none of it (MIGRATION.md §3.1): there is no `MAP_JIT` and no
//! per-thread toggle on Windows, so `jit_write_protect` is a no-op there and
//! the region is executable-and-writable throughout. The icache half is
//! *more* load-bearing, not less — AArch64 has split I/D caches whatever the
//! OS. So P9's order survives verbatim: the flip is free, the invalidation is
//! the substance, and this file needs no `#[cfg]` because
//! [`crate::vendor::wfasm::native_jit`] is already the per-target alias.
