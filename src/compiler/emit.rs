//! IR → `Assembler` calls (`sprint_s10_detail.md` D3.6, D5). Walks
//! `regalloc`'s linearized block order, binds one label per block, and
//! emits each `Ir` op's AArch64 sequence via [`crate::compiler::assembler::Assembler`].
//!
//! **Deviations from D5.3's literal per-op sequences.** D5.3's table
//! writes each sequence in terms of stable-looking `xa`/`xb`/`xd` names,
//! but doesn't work through what happens when one of those names is
//! *itself* a scratch register (x16/x17) because its vreg is spilled —
//! several of the literal sequences alias a spilled operand's holding
//! register with an intermediate result the SAME sequence still needs
//! later, silently corrupting it. Found by tracing through the spilled
//! case by hand before writing any test, not by running one:
//! - **Tag checks** (`SmiArith`/`SmiCmpBr`/`SmiCmpVal`): D5.3 computes
//!   `orr x16, xa, xb` as a combined scratch value to `tst`. If `xa` is
//!   itself x16 (spilled), this overwrites it before the real op reads it
//!   again. Fixed by testing each operand's own tag bits directly
//!   (`tst xa, #3; tst xb, #3`) — logically identical (`(a|b)&3 != 0` iff
//!   `a&3!=0 or b&3!=0`), and `tst` never writes a register at all, so
//!   there is nothing to alias.
//! - **`SmiArith::Mul`**: needs the SAME two operands read by BOTH `mul`
//!   and `smulh` (the overflow check needs the full 128-bit product).
//!   D5.3's sequence writes `mul`'s result into x17 — fine if `b` is a
//!   real register, but if `b` is spilled (loaded into x17), that write
//!   destroys it before `smulh` reads it again. Fixed by re-resolving `b`
//!   fresh (a second reload if spilled — the "at most 2 spilled sources"
//!   accounting D3.5 promises doesn't hold across two SEPARATE
//!   instructions needing the same spilled value) and parking `mul`'s
//!   result in `dst`'s own home (real register, or its own spill slot
//!   used as scratch memory) before computing `smulh`.
//! - **`BoolBr`**: loads `true_obj` into x16 before comparing — if `val`
//!   itself is x16 (spilled), the load destroys it before the compare
//!   reads it. Fixed by always resolving `val` into x16 (this op's only
//!   source) and running BOTH literal loads through x17 instead, which
//!   `val`'s resolution never touches.
//!
//! None of this affects `LoadField`, `Move`, `ConstSmi`/`ConstPool`, or
//! the simple `SmiArith` ops (`Add`/`Sub`/`And`/`Or`/`Xor`) — each reads
//! its spilled-and-reloaded operand(s) exactly once, in a single
//! instruction, so read-then-write self-aliasing (standard ISA semantics)
//! is always safe there.
//!
//! **`mov`'s wide-immediate gap.** The vendored encoder's `mov` does NOT
//! auto-expand an arbitrary 64-bit immediate into a movz/movk sequence —
//! `mov_imm` explicitly `bail!`s if the value isn't a single movz/movn/
//! bitmask-orr pattern (checked directly against the vendored source, not
//! assumed from D5.3's own "(or movz/movk pair for wide — via emit(\"mov\",
//! …) which encode.rs expands)" parenthetical, which does not hold).
//! [`emit_mov_imm64`] does the multi-instruction expansion itself.
