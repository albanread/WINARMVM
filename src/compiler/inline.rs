//! S14 step 3: the inliner's decision surface (SPEC §8.4, sprint_s14_detail
//! "The inliner" ~line 160 and algorithm A2 ~line 233). Maps one send site's
//! [`SiteFeedback`] onto a codegen decision. This is the FIRST speculative
//! codegen step: it only produces `Trap` (for an `Untaken` site, Self's lazy
//! cold path — an uncommon trap that re-executes the send interpreted and warms
//! its IC for the *next* compilation) and `Call` (a plain compiled send, S11).
//! Method and polymorphic INLINING (the `Inline` / `DominantWithSlowPath`

//!
//! **Raw oops, not `Handle`.** The sprint doc's `InlineDecision` uses
//! `Handle<MethodOop>`; `compile_method` runs in a NO-GC window (see
//! `feedback.rs`'s own documented deviation and `driver::compile_method`'s
//! "allocates nothing on the Smalltalk heap" invariant), so a raw
//! `MethodOop`/`KlassOop` read here stays valid for the whole compile. If a
