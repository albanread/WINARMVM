//! The Cocoa bridge, C0 (docs/cocoa_bridge_design.md): `ObjcRef` wrapping,
//! retain-on-wrap / release-with-poison ownership, the per-thread bottom
//! autorelease pool, and Foundation sends through the `@try` exception shim
//! (`objc_shim.m`, compiled by `build.rs`).
//!
//! The memory-model contract (design §2, condensed): the raw `id` lives as
//! **8 raw bytes in the wrapper's indexable byte tail** — the one storage
//! the collector genuinely never walks. Deliberately NOT `Alien`'s
//! named-slot smi idiom: arm64 tagged-pointer objects (small `NSNumber`s,
//! `NSTaggedPointerString`…) set bit 63 — out of smi range — and a raw
//! word in a *named* slot would be oop-scanned, where an id whose low bits
//! resemble `MEM_TAG` gets "relocated" and corrupts the heap. Byte tail,
//! full 64 bits, no exceptions (the adversarial-review finding that
//! reshaped this module before it was written).
//!
//! Ownership (design §3): every `id` crossing in is retained before boxing
//! (C0 retains unconditionally; the +1-family classifier is C1), `release`
//! poisons the wrapper (zeroed tail — subsequent sends fail cleanly, the
//! terminated-worker discipline), and the bias is ALWAYS leak-side: a leak
//! is diagnosable (`wrap`/`release` counters, `MACVM_TRACE=cocoa`); an
//! over-release corrupts a runtime we don't control.
//!
//! The bottom pool (design §3.1): `autorelease` on a thread with no pool
//! doesn't defer — it leaks outright. So the first Cocoa call on a thread
//! pushes a bottom `NSAutoreleasePool` (via the runtime's C entry points),
//! drained + renewed at doit boundaries (`frontend::classdef` calls
//! [`drain_pool_at_doit_boundary`] after every top-level doit — a natural
//! quiescent point: no Cocoa call is in flight between doits). Same
//! arrangement NewBCPL's Cocoa support landed on (`../MacBCPL`,
//! `docs/memory_model.md`).
//!
//! Threading: C0 is VM-thread-only, Foundation-only. The pool is
//! per-thread (`thread_local!`), so worker VMs each get their own on first
//! use. GC safety needs nothing special: the VM is single-threaded and the
//! collector only runs at safepoints on the VM thread — a thread inside
//! `objc_msgSend` is by definition not at a safepoint.

// `@encode` signature (`method_getTypeEncoding`) and parses it into a
// [`Shape`] — the same information `cocoa_data`'s offline tables mirror,
// taken from the authoritative source at runtime. Parsed shapes are cached
// per (class, selector) with hit/miss counters (the design's "PIC-cached
// resolution" — one process-wide map rather than per-send-site PICs in C2;
// per-site caching can ride the real PIC entries when DNU sends compile).

/// One argument's marshalling class, from its `@encode` token. Integer
/// tokens carry their DECLARED width: the marshaller range-checks against
/// it, and any argument narrower than 8 bytes REFUSES to spill to the
/// stack (Darwin packs non-variadic stack args to natural size — an
/// 8-byte spill word for a declared `int` would shift every later stack

// ── C3: the sync main-thread hop (design §4 path 2) ─────────────────────────
//
// AppKit is main-thread-only; the VM lives on its own thread (S21). The
// hop is `dispatch_sync_f` onto the main queue — the C-function form of
// the design's performSelectorOnMainThread mechanism, no Blocks runtime
// needed. Sync-waiting on another thread is safe HERE by architectural
// invariant: the main thread never synchronously waits on the VM
// (vm_host is async by construction — submit + drain-on-wake, S21/M3),
// so no wait cycle can close. The degenerate case — already ON main
// (a Cocoa callback context) — runs inline: that IS the correct sync
// semantics and the non-deadlocking one.
//
// The hop only completes if something drains the main queue (the GUI's
// NSApplication run loop). A headless host has no drain, so the hop is
// GATED: [`enable_main_hop`] is called by a GUI host once its run loop is
// (about to be) live; un-enabled, the hop fails cleanly instead of
// hanging forever.

// libdispatch/pthread entry points — plain libSystem symbols, linked, not
// dlsym'd. `_dispatch_main_q` is the main queue object itself (what the
// dispatch_get_main_queue() macro takes the address of).
//
// WINARM (P0 D2#6): libdispatch and `pthread_main_np` are libSystem symbols
// — they are not merely absent from a Windows link, the CONCEPT is (there is
// no main queue and no framework that owns the main thread). Declaration and
// every use are gated together; the Windows siblings follow each.
