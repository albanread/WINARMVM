//! Multi-Smalltalk workers, M1 — the primary/worker registry and channels
//! (docs/multi-smalltalk-worker.md §3, §5).
//!
//! A worker VM is one OS thread owning a fresh [`crate::embed::VmHandle`] +
//! the receiving end of its inbound channel + a clone of the primary's inbox
//! sender. **Bytes only** ever cross a thread boundary ([`Envelope`] carries
//! a MOP pickle, `runtime::mop`): no oop is visible to two VMs, so the GCs
//! never coordinate.
//!
//! The event router (§3.1) is not a component: it is the inbox channel plus
//! a registered wake hook, and *the send itself is the wake* —
//! [`InboxSender::send`] fires the (coalesced) hook after enqueueing, the
//! shipping `ChannelGameSink` send-then-notify pattern. The coalescing flag
//! clears at the start of a drain ([`WorkerState::poll`]); a send racing in
//! after the clear sets it again and costs at most one harmless extra
//! dispatch — the classic eventfd discipline, never a lost wakeup.
//!
//! Threads are DETACHED, never `.join()`ed — the S21 rule: a worker that
//! died via `pthread_exit` (guest fatal) panics/hangs `join()`. Death is a
//! *message*: the worker's thread body (or the primary's failed send)
//! synthesizes a `#workerDied` envelope through the same inbox as everything
//! else — one delivery mechanism, including for failure (§8).
