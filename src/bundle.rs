//! Bundle self-bootstrap — what the `launcher` shell script used to do.
//!
//! A packaged `.app` carries its whole runtime payload (world `.mst` sources,
//! GUI assets, docs) read-only under `Contents/Resources/payload`, but the VM
//! needs a WRITABLE home (the SQLite image is edited in place). So on launch
//! the payload is copied to `~/Library/Application Support/MACVM/<mode>` and
//! the process runs from there.
//!
//! That used to be a bash script installed as `CFBundleExecutable`, which made
//! the bundle awkward to sign: hardened runtime and entitlements attach to a
//! Mach-O, and a script entry point runs under Apple-signed `/bin/bash` before
//! `exec`ing the real binary — an entitlement chain that is hard to reason
//! about and that notarization flags. Doing it here makes the binary itself the
//! bundle's entry point.
//!
//! Deliberately no subprocess: the old script shelled out to `/usr/bin/ditto`.
//! The recursive copy below keeps the app from spawning anything at startup,
//! which is one less thing to explain to a reviewer and one less binary whose
//! signature has to be trusted.
//!
//! **No-op outside a bundle.** Running `target/release/macvm-cocoa` from the
//! source tree finds no `Contents/Resources/payload` and returns immediately,
//! so the development workflow is untouched.
