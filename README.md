# WINARMVM — Smalltalk, native on Windows ARM64

A Strongtalk-lineage Smalltalk VM — two-tier engine: bytecode interpreter
plus an adaptive optimizing JIT with type feedback, speculative inlining,
and deoptimization — running **natively on Windows 11 ARM64**
(`aarch64-pc-windows-msvc`). Created from [MACVM](https://github.com/albanread/MACVM),
the macOS/Apple-Silicon original, on the premise its author set for this
repo: *the Mac compiler is the seed, not the ceiling — different OS,
different chip; we are using it to create the Windows compiler.* The
AArch64 backend carried over; the OS layer (VirtualAlloc'd code cache with
real icache maintenance, a Vectored Exception Handler decoding A64 `brk`,
a hand-written non-unwinding AArch64 setjmp/longjmp, and two GUI shells —
Win32 + WebView2, and the Win32 + Direct3D 11 one written in Smalltalk) is
this repo's own, and the compiler diverges where this system needs it to —
each divergence marked and explained in place.

**Status: the port is complete — P0 through P5 — and Phase WG's native
environment is built on top of it.** The in-language world suite runs
**17,795 assertions, 0 failed**. The Rust suite runs **1,094 passed / 3
failed / 14 ignored** in release, and the three are named rather than
rounded off: they are `it_tier1` fixtures that compile an nmethod for a
selector they never installed in the synthetic test universe's method
dictionary, which the super-send rule below now correctly declines to key —
the fixtures predate it and were missed when their siblings were updated.
Not a VM defect, and open. One further case in `it_world` fails
intermittently under full-sweep load only; it passes 11/11 whenever that
binary runs on its own, and it predates the fixes below.

JIT, uncommon traps, deopt, guest-fatal recovery, moving GC under compiled
frames, the FFI resolver, and the live-HTML programming environment all
work, all native — VM, JIT, and the WebView2 engine hosting the GUI are
each PE-verified ARM64. The port-defect ledger is closed: no test is gated
on a Windows-divergence claim, and the compiler defects found along the way
are fixed here and have flowed upstream — the S2 trap-site fix (a stale
resident corrupting a deopt slot) and the OSR tiering gap are both in MACVM
now, ported from this repo by name. A third, found by WG3's sub-floor
canary, cured a silent wrong-answer bug: a customized **super-send** target
carries the same `(receiver klass, selector)` pair as the override dynamic
dispatch must reach, so letting it answer `CodeTable::lookup` made ordinary
sends resolve the super target and skip the override — `WinLayout new`
dispatched `^self basicNew` and never ran `initLayout`. An nmethod now
declares whether it `owns_dynamic_key`; a non-owning one stays reachable
through its call site's direct id link and simply never answers lookup.

The 14 ignored gates are not port debt. Ten are two scoped slices of new
work — `kqueue`-shaped readiness (`IoWorker` needs an IOCP or WSAPoll
backend) and the winsock lifecycle, both named in
[`docs/sprints/sprint_p05_detail.md`](docs/sprints/sprint_p05_detail.md).
Three are `subfloor_probe`, deliberately out of contract: below the JIT's
supported threshold the suite is asked to **survive**, not to be correct,
so those probes assert the former and ignore the latter. The last is
`boot_profile`, a measurement rather than an assertion — run it explicitly
alongside `MACVM_BOOT_TIMING=1`, which reports boot as parse 33.7%, methods
27.8% over 2,836 compiles, and 332 class shapes.

**[Phase WG](docs/win_gui_design.md) — WG0 through WG14 have landed:** a
Windows-native environment *written in Smalltalk*, the way the Mac one is.
`macvm-winui` boots a UI VM on the process's main thread, layers
`world/winui.list`, and drives Win32, Direct3D 11 and COM through the FFI.
Rust owns the message pump and nothing else. Screenshots of everything
below: [`docs/gallery-win/`](docs/gallery-win/).

**The door and the drain (WG1–WG3).** A guest Smalltalk doit registers a
window class from winkb-queried struct offsets and opens a **visible**
Windows-11 window — Mica backdrop, system-themed titlebar, per-monitor-V2
DPI, all three set from Smalltalk through `dwmapi`. Windows then calls
**into** Smalltalk: a Rust wndproc trampoline forwards an allowlisted set
of messages into the UI VM as top-level entries —
`WinShell>>window:message:wParam:lParam:` — with a depth guard, a busy
guard, and P2's fault recovery underneath, measured at **8.8 µs** per round
trip against `DefWindowProcW`'s 57 ns. Behind that door sits the real
message architecture: handlers **flag and return**, and a separate drain
pass — woken by a private `WM_APP` message, backstopped by a timer,
suppressed while a modal move/size or menu loop is pumping — does the work
later, on a fresh top-level entry, against settled state. Measured: a burst
of **200 `WM_SIZE` messages produces one layout pass**. The window is
scriptable rather than lookable-at: `MACVM_WINUI_CTL` arms the same control
channel the web GUI uses, so each `just gate-wgN` drives the real window and
checks captured pixels against what it asked for.

**The environment (WG4–WG9).** A view bar with Fluent glyphs and an accent
underline over lazily-built views, a docked Transcript on a splitter, and a
live metrics cluster reading `VmMetrics` off the primary. Then the tools,
each on the primary's own live image: a syntax-coloured **Workspace**
(Ctrl-D / Ctrl-P, ghost line), a four-pane **Browser** whose Accept persists
through `image_store::flows` byte-identically to the web path, an
**Outliner** over the live hierarchy, **Find** for Implementors and Senders
that lands its selection in the Browser, a **Debugger** with the halt loop
fronted natively and the UI still alive, a **Monitor** showing every running
VM, and a **Tests** tab — SUnit moved out of the harness and into
`world/85_sunit.mst`, so a `TestCase` written in the Browser is a real class
in the primary. The editor panes left GDI for a cell grid on DirectWrite
(WG6d), one renderer per pane, which is where the text plane came from.

**The screen is memory (WG8, WG10–WG11).** Upstream's SM0/SM4 — a
`D3D11_USAGE_DYNAMIC` texture the guest stores into through an `Alien`, plus
a 256-word palette — landed as the **Canvas** view. Re-colouring costs the
palette's size, not the screen's: 256 stores against 19,200 at 160×120. On
that plane **all eight of upstream's games run unedited** (`git show
upstream/main:` byte-for-byte): Life, FreeCell, Minesweeper, Plasma, Copper,
Attractor, Julia, Breakout, plus galaxigans on the layer-0 shader — with
sound through XAudio2. Getting there forced one contract fix worth naming:
WINARM had independently allocated primitive ids 266–272 that upstream had
given to GamePane shared memory, so the same Smalltalk meant two different
things on two machines. WINARM's moved to 300–306, and an unimplemented
primitive is now a **fallthrough to the method body**, not a crash — which
is the contract upstream's game wrappers already rely on.

**The declarative UI (WG14)** — *"a first class replacement here for the
cocoa ui"*. Design of record:
[`docs/win_declarative_ui.md`](docs/win_declarative_ui.md). It adopts the
spec+bind contract of
[`wingui`](https://github.com/albanread/wingui) (JSON-shaped node trees,
id-based reconciliation, event names bound to handlers, full-spec republish
with diffing) and implements the realizer **natively in the world layer**,
over the `WinControl` factory, `winui_render` and the door — winscheme's own
precedent, whose reconciler lives in Scheme rather than C++. `WinSpec` is
pure and headless (build, normalize, validate, diff); `WinSpecLayout` is
arithmetic with metrics passed in, testable to the pixel; `WinToolWindow` is
the lifecycle the Mac never abstracted — registry, front-or-build,
hide-on-close, teardown order, beat tick, and the event-depth discipline
that coalesces N state changes into one reconcile. Pane pixels sit outside
the spec, so they get their own channel: a handler **invalidates** a pane or
a region in its own pixels, and the paint block runs once per dirty pane. A
pencil stroke now repaints **729 pixels where the first cut rewrote
186,624** — and the proof is behavioural, since the 16-click diagonal that
lost two thirds of its strokes to a busy VM now lands all 16. The **Sprite
Editor** and **Sound Editor** ship on it, about a fifth the size of the
Cocoa ones they replace, both re-specced landscape by changing only the
spec once `row` learned weighted children.

### Measured, on this machine (Snapdragon X / Oryon)

Against **native Cog** — OpenSmalltalk's `win64ARMv8` Cog[Spur], the only
other native-ARM64 Smalltalk VM Windows has — same checksummed workloads,
same protocol (µs clock, 30 warm-ups, median of 41 samples), interleaved,
no emulation term on either side:

| bench | WINARMVM | Cog | margin |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| arith | 2,031 µs | 10,821 µs | 5.3× |
| fib | 15,300 µs | 30,186 µs | 2.0× |
| sieve | 304 µs | 573 µs | 1.9× |
| dict | 426 µs | 730 µs | 1.7× |
| alloc | 557 µs | 4,165 µs | 7.5× (2.2× vs Cog's best) |
| **richards** | **1,932 µs** | **3,271 µs** | **1.69×** |
| **deltablue** | **211 µs** | **357 µs** | **1.69×** |

Seven for seven; the macro rows are the meaningful ones and the closest.
Reproduce with [`scripts/cog-bench-squeak.st`](scripts/cog-bench-squeak.st)
(the harness in Squeak dialect) — full tables, the same-protocol M4
comparison (the M4 leads six rows at 1.4–1.8×; Oryon takes alloc, and the
GUI's NEON Mandelbrot tile), and every measurement caveat live in
[`docs/PERF.md`](docs/PERF.md).

Those rows are the **JIT's**. The bytecode interpreter is a separate axis and
moved on 2026-08-16, by porting upstream's accessor-inlining and boot work
(`6622bc3`, `8771484`, `add5c86`, `e6b42b3`) — the accessors on the hot path
had never actually been inlined. Under `MACVM_JIT=off`, median of three on
this machine:

| bench | before | after | |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| dispatch (send-heavy) | 1,953 ms | 1,588 ms | **18.7 %** |
| fib | 215 ms | 188 ms | 12.6 % |
| sieve | 243 ms | 214 ms | 11.9 % |

The interpreter commit alone accounts for 13.8 % of the dispatch figure,
measured on its own before the rest went in. `MACVM_BOOT_TIMING=1` reports
the boot those changes were designed against: 45.1 ms total — parse 33.7 %,
methods 27.8 % over 2,836 compiles, 332 class shapes.

### Building & running on Windows

Requirements: Windows 11 ARM64; Visual Studio ARM64 C++ build tools +
Windows SDK; Rust via rustup (the toolchain is pinned by
`rust-toolchain.toml`); Git for Windows (its bash also runs the `justfile`
gates — `set windows-shell` is already configured); WebView2 Evergreen
runtime (in-box on Win11-ARM).

```sh
cargo build --release
target/release/macvm run world/bench/fib.mst --world world
cargo run --release -p win_gui            # macvm-winui — the Windows-native environment (Win32 + D3D11)
cargo run --release -p macvm-gui          # the Strongtalk-style environment (Win32 + WebView2)
```

Every GUI crate (`win_gui`, `gui`, `winui_host`, `winui_render`) is a
**non-default** workspace member, so a bare `cargo build` / `cargo test` at
the top builds and tests `macvm` alone and never links a window — which is
also why the suite counts above are the VM's, not the environment's. Build
them explicitly with `-p`. `winui_host` drops `winui_host.dll` beside
`macvm-winui.exe`, where `LoadLibraryA` finds it.

Env flags are unchanged from MACVM (`MACVM_JIT=off|threshold=N` — the
threshold never goes below 20, rule 1; `MACVM_TRACE=…`, `MACVM_GC_STRESS=…`),
plus `MACVM_WINUI_CTL` to arm the window's scripting channel and
`MACVM_BOOT_TIMING=1` for the boot phase breakdown.
Gates: `just gate-p00` … `gate-p05` are the port ladder and `just gate-wg0`
… `gate-wg9` the environment's, each driving the real window and checking
captured pixels; `just diff-p03` is the JIT-vs-interpreter differential
(zero differences, stdout and exit status, across three JIT modes);
`just gate-cookbook` *evaluates* the fenced blocks in
[`docs/winui-cookbook.md`](docs/winui-cookbook.md) against a live window,
so the prose cannot rot silently.

One caveat on `just lint`: its `cargo fmt --check` half currently fails, and
not on the VM. The GUI crates and `tests/knob_matrix.rs` have drifted out of
rustfmt — 56 diffs across 14 files, none of them under `src/`. Clippy and
the VM's own formatting are clean; that reformat is its own commit and has
not been taken hostage by a functional change.

### The three repos

| repo | platform | role |
|---|---|---|
| [MACVM](https://github.com/albanread/MACVM) | macOS / Apple Silicon | the original; `upstream` remote — portable fixes cherry-pick both ways. Two compiler fixes found here are upstream by name (`545cde4`, `0ca505e`), and MACVM has since adopted **this repo's declarative UI** as its own app portability layer, citing the measurement that WG14's sprite editor carries zero Win32 — its `AppSpec` sprints run the Windows sprite and sound editors on Cocoa, unedited |
| [WINVM](https://github.com/albanread/WINVM) | Windows / x86-64 | the first Windows port; its `MIGRATION.md` playbook seeded this one's OS layer |
| **WINARMVM** (this repo) | **Windows / ARM64** | the Windows compiler grown from the MACVM seed |

Traffic runs the other way too. Ported **in** on 2026-08-16: upstream's
whole-method **GC-map rule** — every nil-filled oop slot claimed at *every*
safepoint, which retires a whole class of path-shaped staleness bugs instead
of patching one more path (upstream had patched four, the last one aborting
its canvas benchmark) — plus an unwind that must cross a `perform:` and a
doit frame, a dissolved local that a nested block captures, the zero-arg
`whileTrue`/`whileFalse` loop forms, and the interpreter/boot set measured
above. Two of those were silent wrong answers, and both are worse here than
upstream reported them: the doit one sits behind the Workspace's Do It
button, and the capture one ends in a **fatal guest error** on this port
where MACVM saw only a `nil` DNU.

Not everything upstream lands is taken, and the `super`-send bug is the
example worth keeping. Both repos found it; the fixes differ. MACVM declines
to compile a method reached only through `super`, leaving it interpreted.
This port compiles it and marks the nmethod as not owning its dynamic key,
so it stays reachable through its call site's direct id link and only ever
skips `CodeTable::lookup` — same bug closed, JIT benefit kept. That
divergence is deliberate and is not scheduled to converge.

### Not ported (yet), by design

Still outstanding: the POSIX-backed world files (dns, sockets, posix_io),
because `IoWorker` needs an IOCP/WSAPoll backend and `kqueue` has no
Windows twin. FFI itself landed in **P5** — the `winkb` Windows-API
knowledge base replaces `cocoa_data`, with an ARM64 argument classifier
re-derived rather than copied from WINVM's x64 one.

Permanently macOS-only and cleanly gated, as *implementations*: the Cocoa
bridge and AppKit GUI (`cocoa_gui`), Accelerate bindings, AVFoundation
(`abc_player`), and the Metal game pane. Their **capabilities** are not
missing here — WG11 rebuilt the game pane on Direct3D 11 and sound on
XAudio2 (`win_gui/src/sound/`), which is what lets upstream's eight games
run unedited; the environment itself is `win_gui` + `winui_render` +
`winui_host` rather than AppKit.

The design of record — component disposition, the five OS seams, every
measured correction (`Δ` entries), and the status log — is
[`MIGRATION.md`](MIGRATION.md); the sprint ladder is Phase P in
[`docs/SPRINTS.md`](docs/SPRINTS.md).

# The MACVM story — the seed this repo grew from

*Everything below is the original macOS README, kept whole because it
still describes ~95 % of this VM — the object model, the compiler, the
world, the philosophy — in its author's own words. Read "macOS/Apple
Silicon" as this repo's birthplace; the Windows deltas live in
[`MIGRATION.md`](MIGRATION.md).*

## Motivation

A from-scratch Apple Silicon compiler for Smalltalk — the most complex
compiler project in my repos, and like the others, it may take a while
before it turns into a useful system.

This isn't a history lesson, just my own experience of one. Strongtalk was
released to the public in 2002 — first as documentation I thoroughly
enjoyed reading, then as full C++ source. At the time it executed Smalltalk
at high speed, and the released repo was fascinating, ambitious, and richly
engineered. I spent many happy hours exploring it and came away impressed
by the design: Strongtalk — and Self before it — pioneered adaptive
optimization (polymorphic inline caches, type feedback, deoptimization),
the ideas that went on to power the Java HotSpot VM, and added on top of
that an optional static type system and a live, hypertext programming
environment. There's a great deal of brilliant engineering there to learn
from and build on.

Decades later, software technology and AI have made life far simpler — it's
much easier to write compilers now, and I find re-implementing a strong,
well-documented design one of the most rewarding ways to work. So MACVM is
built to a large extent on Strongtalk's own design and documentation. I'm
cheating to the maximum extent possible: the bytecode interpreter and
compiler are written in Rust, my own assembler is reused in the compiler,
and only the GC had to be entirely new. It also carries the almost absurd
level of introspection, debugging, and testing a project this complex
needs, in the hope it adds up to reliability.

MACVM is not a port. It's a research virtual machine for macOS on Apple
Silicon (arm64), in the **Self → Strongtalk** lineage: a **class-based
object model** with an **adaptive optimizing compiler** driven by type
feedback. It takes the adaptive-optimization machinery both VMs share
(inline caches, PICs, type feedback, deoptimization) and Strongtalk's
representation (classes + direct pointers, no object table), reimplemented
in Rust for 64-bit Apple Silicon. Both reference VMs are cloned alongside
this repo (`../self-repo`, `../strongtalk-repo`); the source-level analysis
that drove the design is in
[`docs/reference-vm-analysis.md`](docs/reference-vm-analysis.md).

## Status — working, and it compiles

MACVM boots a real Smalltalk object world and runs programs on a **two-tier
engine**: a simple dispatch-based bytecode interpreter plus a **tier-1
optimizing JIT** that
recompiles hot code with type feedback and deoptimizes safely. On the standard
benchmarks the JIT owns essentially all of the runtime — see the
[Benchmarks](#benchmarks--cog-and-macdart-same-workloads-honest-protocol) below;
the interpreter survives only as the differential oracle every JIT change is
gated against.

**Compiler coverage is achieved**: ~98.7% of methods that actually run compile
(the remainder are native primitives, which lose nothing by staying native),
and on real workloads **98.6–99.8% of executed bytecode-work runs as compiled
native code** — including closures, which compile and splice inline rather than
allocating. See [`docs/next_architecture.md`](docs/next_architecture.md) for
the coverage arc and [`docs/PERF.md`](docs/PERF.md) for the benchmark-by-benchmark
measurements.

### Benchmarks — Cog and MACDART, same workloads, honest protocol

MACVM does not compete with Squeak, Pharo, or Cog — those are mature production
systems with decades of engineering behind them. But a JIT needs an honest
yardstick, and Cog (the OpenSmalltalk JIT that powers Squeak and Pharo) is the
meaningful one: same language, same benchmarks, a high bar. The suite now runs
three-way — MACVM, Cog, and **MACDART** (the *same* Smalltalk running JIT-compiled
on a ported Dart 1.24.3 VM) — checksum-verified identical workloads, one rigorous
protocol on every VM ([`scripts/xvm-bench.sh`](scripts/xvm-bench.sh)): a monotonic
**microsecond clock on all sides**, 30 warmup iterations to reach the JIT steady
state, then 41 single-workload samples reporting **median + MAD** (so run-to-run
noise is a printed number, not an RNG), interleaved same-thermal-state rounds,
best-of-7, JIT hot everywhere. µs per iteration, warm — lower is better:

| bench | MACVM | Cog (Pharo 13) | MACDART |
|-----------|------:|------:|------:|
| arith     | 1411 | 5224 | 715 |
| fib       | 9034 | 18726 | 6935 |
| sieve     | 180 | 362 | 196 |
| dict      | 255 | 1024 | 457 |
| alloc     | 587 | 701 | 384 |
| richards  | 1087 | 2223 | 628 |
| deltablue | 150 | 280 | 300 |

**MACVM is ahead of Cog on all seven.** Against MACDART it splits by workload
shape: MACVM wins the allocation-bound benches — sieve (1.1×), dict (1.8×) and
deltablue (2.0×), its generational scavenger's home turf — and MACDART wins the
compute/dispatch-bound ones: arith (2.0×), fib (1.3×), alloc (1.5×), richards
(1.7×). Cog is never the fastest of the three.

Both margins moved in August 2026, in opposite directions and for the same
reason — each VM went after its own weakest layer. MACDART removed dispatch
overhead from its Smalltalk front end (deltablue 1271 → 299 µs, from a 4.6× loss
against Cog to a statistical tie), which narrowed MACVM's lead on the
allocation-bound rows. MACVM then went after its register allocator and codegen
(richards 1440 → 1087, fib 10790 → 9034), which narrowed MACDART's lead on the
compute rows from 2.3× to 1.7× on richards. Neither VM's *engine* changed to
chase the other; both simply had a layer that was costing more than it should.
See [`docs/regalloc_findings.md`](docs/regalloc_findings.md) for MACVM's side of
that — including the three changes the A/B gate rejected.

One methodology note, earned the hard way: MACVM's JIT must be engaged with
`MACVM_JIT=threshold=…`. The default `macvm run` path is the *interpreter* — cold
== warm, ~50–170× slower — which silently made an earlier scoreboard here
meaningless. The harness sets the flag and says why, so the trap can't recur. The
full measured record is [`docs/cog_bench.md`](docs/cog_bench.md).

### What's implemented

- **Object model** — Strongtalk-style classes, direct tagged pointers, **no
  object table**, a 2-word `[mark][klass]` header.
- **Garbage collection** — generational scavenge + a full compacting collector,
  both running **under live, moving compiled frames** via precise oop-maps and a
  mixed-tier frame walker.
- **Interpreter** — a simple dispatch-based bytecode baseline tier (a
  fetch-decode-`match` loop) with inline caches.
- **Tier-1 optimizing JIT** — a vendored pure-Rust AArch64 encoder (JASM) behind
  the `Assembler` trait; PICs and type feedback; method + block inlining;
  per-klass **customization** with self-send and block-arg **devirtualization**;
  **deoptimization**, **on-stack replacement (OSR)**, and recompile-on-trap.
- **Closure compilation** — literal blocks compile and splice inline, including
  multi-basic-block conditional-`^` (non-local-return) blocks, with `Context`
  elision / materialization / adoption across the tier boundary.
- **FFI** — Tier-1 POSIX via `dlsym` + shape-keyed native-call trampolines +
  an `Alien` raw-memory type ([`docs/FFI.md`](docs/FFI.md)).
- **SIMD** — NEON vector support in two layers: `Float64x2` / `Float32x4` /
  `Int32x4` **value classes** whose arithmetic the JIT fuses to single NEON
  instructions, and `FloatArray` **bulk kernels** (`+@`, `sum`, `dot:`,
  `scale:`, `min`/`max`) as explicit hand-written NEON in Rust
  ([`docs/SIMD.md`](docs/SIMD.md)).
- **Debugger** — crash-dossier (PROBE), breakpoints, mixed-tier backtrace, an
  a64 disassembler, IR dumps, and step-between-calls ([`docs/DEBUGGER.md`](docs/DEBUGGER.md)).
- **Optional static types** — a Strongtalk-style optional type checker:
  annotate parameters/returns/instance variables
  (`aNumber <Number> ^ <Boolean>`), get nominal + block + union subtyping, a
  real `Self`, and a **static-DNU** send rule flagging a selector no
  reachable class implements — strictly advisory (a byte-identical
  differential gate proves annotations never reach codegen) and gradual (an
  unannotated program checks clean by construction). **The entire core
  library is annotated** — 739 method signatures, real world, 0 findings —
  staged T0′→T4 against Strongtalk's own signature sources, fixing five
  genuine soundness bugs in the checker itself along the way, each caught
  only by running it against the real ~150-class world
  ([`docs/typechecker_design.md`](docs/typechecker_design.md)).
- **Image store** — offline SQLite image editing + a DB→VM boot loader that
  reconstructs the world byte-identically to a `.mst` boot ([`docs/IMAGE.md`](docs/IMAGE.md)).
- **Embedding + two GUIs** — a `VmHandle` library API embeds the language on
  a dedicated thread that survives a guest-thread crash, behind **two
  independent front-ends** built on the same primitives:
  - **`gui/` (`macvm-gui`)** — a faithful recreation of the 1996
    **Strongtalk hypertext programming environment**, rendered as HTML in a
    `WKWebView` inside a native Cocoa window/menu bar/toolbar. The truer
    read of the original interface, and the one with the built-in help +
    tour.
  - **`cocoa_gui/` (`macvm-cocoa`)** — a lighter, **native AppKit shell
    whose own interface is written in Smalltalk**: real Cocoa views
    (`NSButton`, `NSOutlineView`, `NSTextView`, …), driven by a Smalltalk VM
    pinned to the main thread through the Cocoa bridge — no HTML, no JS, no
    WebKit process. The environment *is* the language, all the way up.

  Both ship the same core toolset — a live **class browser** whose accepts
  compile into the running VM *and* persist to the image, an outliner,
  **find tools** (definitions, implementors, senders — SQLite-indexed), a
  **Workspace** with do-it/print-it, a **Canvas** drawing widget, and a live
  **VM/GC metrics dashboard** — each built the way its own front-end works
  best (`gui/`'s tools are DB-and-JS-driven; `cocoa_gui/`'s browser is
  DB-backed while its outliner reflects the live VM directly)
  ([`docs/vm_handle.md`](docs/vm_handle.md), [`gui/PLAN.md`](gui/PLAN.md),
  [`docs/cocoa_gui_design.md`](docs/cocoa_gui_design.md)).
- **Game engine** — a native Metal game pane driven entirely from Smalltalk: an
  8-bit indexed drawing surface, retained GPU sprites, a 60 fps frame loop with
  keyboard input, and sound effects + ABC-notation music through AVFoundation,
  via the [MacGamePane](https://github.com/albanread/MacGamePane) engine
  ([`docs/gamepane_design.md`](docs/gamepane_design.md)). The GUI's **Demos**
  menu ships four, all written in Smalltalk: `Breakout`
  ([`world/44_breakout.mst`](world/44_breakout.mst)), a small but complete
  paddle-ball-bricks game; `MandelZoom`
  ([`world/45_mandelzoom.mst`](world/45_mandelzoom.mst)), a live zooming
  Mandelbrot (the JIT-compiled escape-time float math); the same dive run in a
  **spawned second VM**; and `ParallelMandel`
  ([`world/48_parallelmandel.mst`](world/48_parallelmandel.mst)) — the dive
  with **every frame computed in parallel bands by 4 worker VMs** (below).
- **Multi-VM workers** — true multicore parallelism, driven entirely from
  Smalltalk: `Worker spawn:` boots **worker VMs** (each its own heap, JIT, and
  GC on its own OS thread) that communicate with the primary by **deep-copy
  message passing** (the MOP pickle) — Erlang-style share-nothing, no shared
  state, no identity across heaps, consistent with the `become:` stance below.
  A primary can hold a pool of **up to 16 concurrent worker VMs**, each
  independently addressable (`send:onReply:` per worker) — a star topology:
  every worker talks only to the primary, and workers don't spawn sub-workers
  (a v1 rule the registry design doesn't preclude lifting later).
  Fully asynchronous: replies run as `send:onReply:` continuations and delivery
  is event-driven — the send itself wakes the sleeping receiver (a coalesced,
  never-lost wake), so **no one ever polls for a message** and a worker with
  nothing to do sleeps at zero CPU. (Honesty note: that claim is about the
  message plane. The Cocoa GUI's supervisor does run a deliberate slow
  heartbeat — ~4 Hz, control-plane housekeeping only: stop flags, toolbar
  metrics, servicing parked requests such as File In — and the shell's
  flag-and-drain pattern sweeps its request flags on each pass, made prompt by
  a run-loop wake. Bounded ticks by design, not message delivery; the headless
  worker system runs with no beat at all.) A crashed worker dies alone and is
  reported as an ordinary `#workerDied` message. `ParallelMandel` measures **~2.65 CPUs of sustained
  utilization with 4 workers** on the live zooming Mandelbrot — visibly faster
  than the single-VM dive ([`docs/multi-smalltalk-worker.md`](docs/multi-smalltalk-worker.md)).
- **OTP-style supervision** — a supervision layer over the worker fleet:
  MACVM has no exception system (`self error:` stops the computation
  outright, and scoped `catch` was deliberately rejected), so a crashed
  worker is answered Erlang/OTP-style instead — reported as the ordinary
  `#workerDied` message above, and a `WorkerSupervisor` restarts it by
  declared policy (`#oneForOne` / `#oneForAll` / `#restForOne`), with
  supervisors nesting into trees and a child that exhausts its own restart
  budget escalating to its parent. `WorkerNames` rebinds a service's name on
  every restart so callers never hold a handle to a corpse; `ServiceWorker`'s
  deadline-bounded `call:timeoutMs:onReply:onError:` funnels every failure
  mode — timeout, death, an RPC error — into one callback, never a block,
  with nothing ever blocking to enforce it. The `IoWorker` (a
  `kqueue`-multiplexing I/O service) is the first real service supervised
  this way: its kernel-level watch registrations live in the *primary* and
  survive a worker's crash untouched, so a supervised restart needs no
  re-registration at all ([`docs/otp_workers_design.md`](docs/otp_workers_design.md)).
- **The object world** — 155 classes / 1,872 methods of hand-written and
  Strongtalk-ported library (`world/*.mst`, `world.list`'s own 74 files;
  counted via `ClassMirror allClasses`, own — not inherited — selectors):
  full collections + streams protocol, Dictionary/Set/OrderedCollection,
  String/Character text utilities, Fraction and LargeInteger arithmetic, an
  in-language test suite, and the Richards / DeltaBlue / Stanford benchmark
  ports in `world/bench/` (counted separately — loaded on demand, not part
  of the boot-time figure above).
- **Scripting** — an embedded RUSTTCL console for driving the VM and its
  debugger ([`docs/RUSTTCL.md`](docs/RUSTTCL.md)).

### Cocoa from Smalltalk

MACVM talks to macOS directly. Foundation and AppKit objects are ordinary
Smalltalk receivers — look a class up once and Objective-C messages are
plain keyword sends, with argument and return types read from the live
runtime's own method signatures:

```smalltalk
s := (Cocoa classNamed: 'NSMutableString') alloc init.
s appendString: 'hello'.
s length.                        "→ 5"

win onMain makeKeyAndOrderFront: nil.          "AppKit runs on the main thread"
act := Cocoa action: [ Transcript showCr: 'clicked!' ].
btn onMain setTarget: act.  btn onMain setAction: 'macvmFire:'.
```

A Cocoa object lives in Smalltalk as an `ObjcRef` holding one retained
reference — the moving GC and Objective-C's reference counting never see
each other's pointers, exceptions are caught at the boundary, and the
bridge always errs toward a leak, never a double-free (`release`,
`poolDo:`, and ARC's naming conventions do the bookkeeping). Button
clicks travel back over the same inbox the worker VMs use and run
between doits on the VM thread. The **Demos → CocoaPad** menu item
builds a native `NSWindow` with a live button entirely from
`world/50_cocoapad.mst`; the design is in
[`docs/cocoa_bridge_design.md`](docs/cocoa_bridge_design.md), the user
guide in the in-app help (Help → MACVM Documentation → Cocoa from
Smalltalk).

### Fast floating point

Strongtalk's tour introduced the idea of "fast floats" — eliminating the
allocation for intermediate results within a method — and sketched an
experimental scheme for it. MACVM builds that idea out fully in the tier-1
JIT as **float regions**: a mono-`Double` send site (the inline cache
is the type oracle) compiles to a guarded unbox, native `fmul`/`fadd`/`fcmp`,
and a box only where a boxed value is actually observed. Inside a region there
is **no allocation, no GC interaction, and no message send — just assembler
maths and libm calls**:

- **A second register file.** Unboxed floats live in `d0`–`d7` scratch plus a
  `d8`–`d15` write-through residency tier, fully independent of the GPR
  allocator. A raw `f64` is invisible to the moving GC (never in an oop map,
  never scanned), which is what makes registers-across-safepoints cheap here.
- **A box/unbox reducer.** `FUnbox(FBox x) → x` cancellation, dead-box
  elimination, deopt-sunk boxing (an intermediate needed only by deopt
  metadata is boxed *in the trap's own cold block*), literal folding, and
  **float-temp promotion** — a temp that provably always holds a `Double`
  lives as a raw `f64` across the whole loop, safepoints included.
- **Honest deoptimization.** One new deopt-map kind (`DoubleSlot`) tells the
  materializer "this frame slot is raw float bits — box it back"; everything
  else reuses the existing trap/reexecute machinery, verified by pinned
  forced-deopt-mid-loop regressions.
- **libm transcendentals** — `sin cos tan exp ln atan sqrt` as primitives;
  libm preserves the callee-saved `d`-registers, so a plotted curve costs one
  library call per point plus register arithmetic.

Measured on the WKWebView GUI's Mandelbrot demo (420×220, release, Apple
Silicon), each layer removing a *category* of cost:

| stage | time | allocation per render |
|-------|------|-----------------------|
| boxed sends (before) | 746 ms | 708 MB |
| pixel-buffer output | 458 ms | 595 MB |
| float-region fuse | 180 ms | 595 MB |
| sunk boxing + temp promotion | 166 ms | 4 MB |
| strength-reduced coordinates | 38 ms | 0 |
| **d-register residency** | **25 ms** | **0** |

**~30× end to end, with zero allocation, zero deopts, and one scavenge-free
heap per render.** Full design, the measured-and-rejected variants included,
in [`docs/float_fastpath_design.md`](docs/float_fastpath_design.md).

**How close is that to C?** The honest external yardstick — the *identical*
Mandelbrot kernel hand-ported to C (same 420×220, same escape loop and
coordinate accumulation, checksum-verified equal work), compiled with the same
Apple `clang`, warmed, best-of-30 on the same machine:

| engine | time | vs C ‑O2 |
|--------|------|----------|
| C, ‑O2 (== ‑O3 ‑march=native) | 4.6 ms | 1.0× |
| C, ‑O0 | 13.1 ms | 2.9× |
| **MACVM tier‑1 JIT** | **25.2 ms**¹ | **5.5×** |
| MACVM interpreter | 3406 ms¹ | 745× |

¹ Independently re-timed 2026-07-19 (23 ms / 3337 ms — within noise; see
[`docs/float_fastpath_design.md`](docs/float_fastpath_design.md)'s own
verification note). This repo has no committed C source or build script for
the two C rows, so only MACVM's own two rows are source-verifiable here.

So the tier‑1 JIT lands **~1.9× off *unoptimized* C and ~5.5× off optimized
C** — solid-baseline-JIT territory for a dynamic language (the "~30×" above is
against our own interpreter floor, not against C; absolute times are the fair
measure). The remaining gap to ‑O2 is specific and known: no FMA fusion
(`fmul; fadd` vs a single `fmadd`), and `escapeAtRe:im:` is still a per‑pixel
compiled *send* rather than inlined into the pixel loop the way C inlines
`escape()`.

### Optional static types

Strongtalk's tour named two headline ideas beyond adaptive optimization: a
live hypertext environment (both GUIs, above) and an *optional* static type
system layered over ordinary dynamic Smalltalk — types where you want them,
nothing else changes where you don't. MACVM ports that idea as a genuine
Rust reimplementation (not a Smalltalk port), staged T0′→T4 against
Strongtalk's own `.dlt` sources as the executable spec:

```smalltalk
Magnitude subclass: Number [
    max: aMagnitude <Magnitude> ^ <Magnitude> [
        ^self < aMagnitude ifTrue: [ aMagnitude ] ifFalse: [ self ]
    ]
]
```

- **T0′** — the parser captures annotations instead of discarding them.
- **T1** — a `TypeExpr` grammar (named / generic / block / union types) and
  a VM-free `WorldModel`, built by re-parsing the world with no `VmState`
  involved at all.
- **T2** — real subtyping: nominal (superclass chain), `Self` resolved
  against the enclosing class, blocks checked contravariantly on arguments
  and covariantly on return, unions distributing.
- **T3** — the send rule: **static-DNU** (a selector no reachable class
  implements, on a receiver whose type is known) plus per-argument subtype
  checks.
- **T4** — the entire core library annotated, signatures ported from
  Strongtalk's own where they exist and inferred mechanically from our own
  code where they don't: **739 method signatures, real world, 0 findings.**

Two things make it safe to ship as advisory-only:

- **Isolation.** `src/types/` is reachable from exactly one place — the
  `macvm typecheck` subcommand — verified by grep after every stage.
  Nothing it does can ever reach codegen.
- **A byte-identical differential gate.** The world compiles to the *exact
  same bytecode* with or without every annotation ever written — proven on
  every commit, the same discipline this project applies to every JIT
  change.

That safety net is what makes the interesting part possible: **finding
real soundness bugs in the checker itself by actually running it against a
substantial, real library**, rather than by inspection — five of them,
across five stages. The first: a naive `Self`-typed dispatch check flagged
97 false positives the moment it met real code — `Number>>log` sends `self
asFloat`, but `Number` itself never implements `asFloat`, only its concrete
subclasses do (the ordinary Template Method pattern). The fix — a
`Self`-typed receiver *declines* checking rather than guesses — is the same
stance this whole project takes toward any claim it can't verify. Full
design and every stage's gate:
[`docs/typechecker_design.md`](docs/typechecker_design.md).

### Replace, don't mutate — there is no persistent image

MACVM never mutates a persistent image. Where classic Smalltalk carries one
long-lived heap snapshot forward across years of in-place modification, MACVM
keeps its truth in a **source-code database** — the `.mst` world files and the
SQLite image they seed — and spins up VMs from it in well under a second. VMs
are plural and disposable: the system would always rather **throw a VM away and
rebuild it from source than mutate one in place**.

You can feel the difference in the tools. When you file development code into
the GUI, it is not patched into the long-running VM: a **fresh VM is recreated
from the world and your file loads on top of it**. Filing in the same file
twenty times just works — there is no accumulated state to collide with,
because there is no accumulated state at all. To a Smalltalker raised on the
image this reads as less dynamic, almost static. In operation, though, MACVM is
a true Smalltalk system — live objects, live compilation, everything inspectable
while it runs. The difference is only in how change lands: **replacement instead
of mutation**, with every piece of state visible in source you can read, diff,
and version — never implicit in a heap that remembers things no one can point
to.

### Why there's no `become:`

MACVM has no `become:` — the Smalltalk primitive that swaps one object's
identity for another's, redirecting every reference in the system at once. This
is a deliberate omission, and it's worth being honest about the cost before the
justification.

**What we lose.** `become:` is the classic tool for three things, and we give
all three up:

- **Live schema migration.** Add an instance variable to a class and, with
  `become:`, you can reshape every *existing* instance in place while preserving
  its identity and every reference to it. Without it, instances keep their old
  shape until they are recreated — so objects built up in memory during a
  session can't be upgraded live.
- **Transparent replacement.** Proxies, lazy-loading stubs that resolve into the
  real object, futures, copy-on-write — anything that substitutes one object for
  another while everyone holding a reference keeps working. `become:` does this
  atomically; we must use explicit indirection (a handle, or `doesNotUnderstand:`
  forwarding), which leaks into the API and means identity (`==`) is the
  wrapper's, not the target's.
- **`becomeForward:` bulk redirection**, used by image loaders and some
  compaction tricks.

These are real capabilities, not corner cases — a Smalltalker who reaches for
`become:` will find it missing.

**Why it's gone.** MACVM — like Strongtalk and Self before it — represents an
object reference as the **raw machine address of the object body**, not as an
index into an object table. That is the choice that makes a field access a
single load and lets the JIT cache classes at send sites, build PICs, and
inline — the whole basis of the adaptive optimizer. But it also means
"redirect every reference to A so it points to B" has no cheap implementation:
there is no table slot to swap, only every pointer in both heap generations,
every root, every live stack frame, and every machine register to find and
rewrite. Strongtalk *does* keep a `become:` primitive and implements it exactly
that way — `deoptimize_all()` followed by a full-heap scan — and its own tour
calls it "prohibitively slow" and "not supported." For an optimizing VM the scan
is only half the cost: a `become:` that changes an object's class invalidates
every cached class in the code cache, and one that reshapes an object
invalidates the fixed field offsets baked into compiled code, forcing a global
deoptimization. `become:` fights everything the compiler is built to do.

**Why we can afford to skip it — MACVM is not image-based.** There is no
persistent snapshot of the live object heap (the `image.sqlite3` MACVM can boot
from is a database of class/method *source*, not a heap dump). A snapshot is
what historically *made* `become:` load-bearing: a decades-old living image can
never be restarted, so its objects must be migrated in place. MACVM instead
rebuilds its entire world from source — `.mst` files, or the SQLite source
database — on every boot, and that boot takes **well under a second** for the
whole standard world. So the dominant use of `become:` — evolving a class whose
instances you can't afford to lose — is answered by editing the source and
restarting, not by mutating a live heap. Class redefinition itself already goes
through the deoptimize-and-recompile path the VM has for exactly this. The
residual, real loss is schema-migrating or transparently proxying objects
*within a single running session* — and that is the price we pay, knowingly,
for direct pointers and a fast JIT.

## Building & running

```sh
cargo build --release
target/release/macvm run world/bench/fib.mst --world world          # runs it
# (richards/deltablue now live IN the standard world for the dashboard —
#  run them via scripts/cog-bench.mst or the GUI's benchmarks, not the
#  standalone world/bench files, which would redefine their classes)
MACVM_JIT=off   target/release/macvm run <prog>.mst --world world   # interpreter only
MACVM_JIT=threshold=200 …                                            # JIT (default gate)
MACVM_TRACE=stats|jit|deopt|count …                                  # instrumentation
```

The JIT is on by default. `MACVM_JIT=off` selects the interpreter, which is the
differential oracle every JIT change is gated against (compiled output must be
byte-identical to interpreted output). Tests: `cargo test`; the stress matrix
(GC / deopt) and world differentials are in `tests/` and the `justfile` gates.

Either GUI launches with a release build by default (both default to `dev`
under a bare `cargo run`, which measures tens of times slower on
compute-heavy demos like the Mandelbrot dives — these scripts exist
specifically to avoid that trap):

```sh
./run-gui.sh      # the WKWebView Strongtalk-style environment (macvm-gui)
./run-cocoa.sh    # the native AppKit environment, written in Smalltalk (macvm-cocoa)
```

> **Windows note:** on this repo the same `macvm-gui` crate builds the
> Win32 + WebView2 shell — `cargo run --release -p macvm-gui` (release
> matters; the dev-profile trap described above applies with full force).
> `run-cocoa.sh`, the AppKit environment, and the Demos' game pane are
> macOS-only and stay behind their gates.

Both share the **Demos** menu (Breakout and the three Mandelbrots, including
the 4-worker parallel dive); `./run-mandelvm.sh` runs the standalone
one-dive demo window that exits itself. The WKWebView GUI boots its whole
interface from a SQLite **image** (`world/image.sqlite3`) rebuilt from the
`world/*.mst` source; the Cocoa GUI boots classes straight from `.mst`
source every launch, but its DB-backed browser/find tools read the same
image. After changing a world class, rebuild the image with
`./reseed-world.sh` (build + fresh reseed + boot-check) — see
[`docs/managingtheworld.md`](docs/managingtheworld.md) for the full workflow and
gotchas.

## Lineage & licensing

Self and Strongtalk were released under BSD-style licenses. Code adapted from
them retains its original notices; new MACVM code is under the license in
[`LICENSE`](LICENSE). See `docs/DESIGN.md` for provenance tracking.

## Further reading

MACVM's technical origin is **Strongtalk** — the Motivation section above is
about exactly that, and the original system lives on at
[strongtalk.org](https://strongtalk.org/) and
[talksmall/Strongtalk](https://github.com/talksmall/Strongtalk).

**Cog** is the other great branch of the Self family tree — the production
JIT that, from a deliberately simpler baseline design, still keeps pace with
Strongtalk's — and it is by far the best-documented. Eliot Miranda's
[Cog Blog](http://www.mirandabanda.org/cogblog/) is the clearest published
explanation anywhere of the machinery a Smalltalk VM actually needs
(remarkably, Cog is itself written in Smalltalk, translated to C for the
build). If the internals here interest you, read him:
