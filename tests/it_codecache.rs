//! Sprint S9 integration/golden tests (`tests_s09.md` §Integration/golden
//! tests, acceptance gate items 2-4). Unit tests in `compiler::jasm_assembler`
//! and `codecache` (+ `codecache::guard`) cover encoding and allocator
//! mechanics in isolation; these exercise the whole emit -> publish -> run,
//! and publish -> patch -> rerun, pipelines end to end, entirely through the
//! crate's public API — same spirit as `it_gc_full.rs`'s S8 coverage.
//!
//! This file is allowed `unsafe` (it lives in `tests/`, a separate crate
//! from `macvm` itself, so `src/lib.rs`'s `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` doesn't
//! reach here) — every call into published code goes through the one
//! [`call1`] helper.
//!
//! All tests run on the main test thread, never inside `std::thread::spawn`
//! — the write-protect toggle is per-thread (S9 P3); a helper-thread version
//! would pass or fail for reasons unrelated to what's being tested.
