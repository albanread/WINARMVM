# MACVM CI contract. See docs/sprints/CONVENTIONS.md and
# docs/sprints/sprint_s00_detail.md — this file IS the CI contract until a
# hosted CI is set up.

# WINARM (P0): every recipe below is written in POSIX shell — `/tmp/` paths,
# `diff`, `sed`, and `VAR=value cmd` env prefixes. `just`'s default shell on
# Windows is `cmd`, which understands none of that, so the gates would fail
# for reasons that have nothing to do with the VM. This setting affects
# WINDOWS ONLY (`windows-shell`, not `shell`), so the macOS side keeps its
# default `sh` and every existing recipe stays byte-identical there — the
# same gate-don't-fork discipline MIGRATION.md §2 applies to source files.
# Requires Git for Windows' bash on PATH, which the toolchain already needs.

# --- Phase P: the Windows-ARM64 port (MIGRATION.md, docs/sprints/*p0*) ------
#
# The P gates deliberately do NOT chain the S gates. An S gate is a claim
# about a FEATURE landing ("the scavenger works"); a P gate is a claim about
# a PLATFORM ("all of it still works over there"), so P0 re-runs the whole
# suite rather than inheriting a ladder. They also cannot chain in the other
# direction: P0's whole point is that the JIT is off, while gate-s10 and up
# require it on.
#
# P0 (docs/sprints/tests_p00.md): interpreter-only Windows ARM64 is green.
# `ci` covers build + clippy + `cargo test`; the world run is what proves a
# real Smalltalk world boots and its in-language suite passes -- the number
# that gets compared against the Mac build of the same commit (gate item 3).

# P2 (docs/sprints/tests_p02.md): the trap layer is alive — a compiled
# `brk #0xDExx` round-trips through the VEH into the deopt trampolines, and a
# guest-fatal / foreign fault recovers through the hand-written non-unwinding
# AArch64 setjmp/longjmp instead of killing the process. `ci`'s `cargo test`
# already carries the whole gate: the isolated jump + VEH probes, the AV
# recovery, the concurrency stress, and — the part that matters most — the 52
# tests P0 marked `#[cfg_attr(windows, ignore = "P2: …")]`, now un-gated and
# running. The second recipe is the end-to-end integration check
# MIGRATION.md §3.2 specifies: the same script must print and exit 0 with the
# JIT off AND with it on (before P2 the JIT-on run died at once with
# 0xC000001D).
#
# P1 (docs/sprints/tests_p01.md): the JIT substrate on target. Most of this
# gate is the S9 codecache suite, which `ci` already runs; what the recipe
# adds is running it in isolation, so a failure here reads as "the loader,
# the region, relocation or the W^X/icache path broke" rather than being one
# red line among a thousand. The vendored encoder's frozen corpus is included
# for the same reason.
#
# Note what this gate does NOT claim. `patch_flip_churn_stays_coherent` runs
# a thousand patch-then-execute cycles, and it passes with BOTH halves of
# `icache_invalidate` commented out (measured — sprint_p01_detail.md's Δ). It
# is a regression test for the patch path, not evidence the flush works; on
# this Snapdragon/Oryon host a missing flush is simply not observable.

# One honest note about the chain rather than a silent divergence:
#   * `ci` runs `lint`, and `cargo fmt --check`/`clippy -D warnings` still
#     fail under rustc 1.97.1 on files this port never touched
#     (MIGRATION.md §8, P0's "Open, and not a port problem"). That is
#     unchanged by P2 and is why the sprint verifies with `cargo test
#     --no-fail-fast` directly as well.
